This file is an example of \verb=\omitcite=, 
it explains usage and some errors. 
In the case of the Raweb: there are three 
bibliography files Year, Foot, and Refer.  
The Refer file has implicitly a \verb=\nocite{*}= .
The Year file is automatically generated with a \verb=\nocite{*}=.
You can cite via \verb=\yearcite{foo}=, \verb=\footcite{foo}= or 
\verb=\refercite{foo}=. This allows the same name to appear in the
three files; for simplicity there is a unique command to omit a
citation; it will omit it everywhere

We first define a bibliography file,  :

\begin{filecontents+}{om.bib}
 @book {refA , author = "Aname,  Afirst",  title="Atitle"}
 @book {refB , author = "Bname,  Bfirst",	title="Btitle"}
 @book {refc , author = "Cname, Cfirst",	title="Ctitle"}
 @book {refD , author = "Dname, Dfirst", title="Dtitle"}
 @book {refE , author = "Ename, Efirst", title="Etitle"}
 @book {refF , author = "Fname, Ffirst", title="Ftitle"}
\end{filecontents+}

We use this file as the bibliography file and import everything
\bibliography{om}
\nocite{*}
We cite the first three items
\cite{refa}\cite{refB} \cite{refC}
We try: \cite{reafA}; this fails because the case is irrelevant as long as
the same key is used in the text file

The argument of \verb=\omitcite=  must expand to a character string, 
example: \omitcite{José Grimm}
or \def\prefix#1{ref#1}  \omitcite{\prefix D} \omitcite{\prefix e}
but not \omitcite{\xmlelt{This cannot work}{val}}

The case is important:  reference refE is not ignored
This gives a conflict  \cite{reff}\omitcite{refF}
the reference is omitted and cannot be solved

The transcript file should contain
\begin{verbatim}
\omitcite(1) = José Grimm}
{\omitcite(2) = refD}
{\omitcite(3) = refe}
{\omitcite(4) = }
{\omitcite(5) = refF}
\end{verbatim}

There is an error with message
  unexpected element This cannot work.
that yields an empty name.

After that there is 
\begin{verbatim}
Bib stats: seen 5 entries.
bib: Omitting refD
bib: Omitting refF
\end{verbatim}
The first line says: there are 5 citations to solve. It is followed by 
the list of entries of the bibliograph to be explicitly ignored.


There is also
\begin{verbatim}
Error signaled while handling entry cite:reafA
undefined reference.
Error signaled while handling entry cite:reff
undefined reference.
\end{verbatim}
