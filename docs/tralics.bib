  abstract = {This paper describes how Tralics converts a sequence characters into a sequence of tokens, into a math list, and finally into a MathML formula. Tokenisation rules are the same as in TeX, the meaning of these tokens is the same as in LaTeX, and can be given in packages. Math formulas are handled in the same spirit as TeX, but construction of the MathML result is not obvious, due to particularities of both TeX and MathML.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to show that it is possible to translate almost every mathematical formula from LaTeX syntax to XML. The document you are reading contains a great number of formulas extracted from the TeX book, the LaTeX companion, the MathML recommendation, and translated into XML by Tralics; it is available in Pdf or HTML version. The HTML version was produced using a very simple style sheet; mathematics are left unchanged, and you need a MathML-aware browser, like Firefox, or adequate plugins, and a set of fonts for the symbols or operators. The Pdf version was obtained by use of xmltex (a package by D. Carlisle that makes TeX an XML interpreter), and a great number of modifications to the file mathml2.xmt (that interprets elements in the MathML namespace). All files needed to produce this document are part of the Tralics bundle (version 2.10 or more).},

The first example is the Inria’s Activity Report, for which the printed reference (the PDF version) is obtained from the XML. The second example concerns a PHD thesis, whose translation to HTML was undertaken after the defence, and needed some adaptations.},
